# Aeon — AI-Powered Engineering Operations Workspace

> Every incident your team has ever seen. Every failure that's coming next. One workspace.

"Odysseus for DevOps" — an AI OS for engineering operations combining GitHub Actions, Jenkins, n8n, persistent memory (ChromaDB + Neo4j), and a LangGraph agent for CI/CD root cause analysis, prediction, and automated remediation.

Three AI intelligence features sit on top of that foundation: **Code Provenance** (why is this code the way it is?), **Blast Radius** (what will break if I merge this?), and a **Knowledge Graph** of all incident relationships.

## The Demo Flow

### Incident Response (Core)
```
Push to GitHub / Jenkins build runs
        ↓
Aeon Pipelines page shows failure in real time
        ↓
Ask AI: "Why did the Android build fail?"
        ↓
Agent streams live tool calls (search_memory, fetch_logs...)
        ↓
AI returns: root cause + 91% confidence
            + "matches incident #421 from 3 weeks ago"
            + suggested fix
        ↓
Click "Create Issue" → GitHub issue created live
        ↓
Click "Approve PR" → PR created (human in the loop)
        ↓
Incident stored in memory — AI gets smarter for next time
```

### Code Provenance
```
Enter: github repo + file path
        ↓
Aeon traces commit history → linked PRs → linked issues
        ↓
Graph renders: File → Commits → PRs → Issues → Developers
        ↓
AI Evolution Narrative: "Why is this file the way it is today?"
        ↓
Click any commit → see actual diff with added/removed lines
        ↓
Toggle Timeline layout: commits ordered chronologically left→right
```

### Blast Radius
```
Enter: github repo + PR number
        ↓
Aeon fetches all changed files from GitHub
        ↓
Classifies each file: Service / Test / Config / Pipeline / Infra / Dependencies
        ↓
Radial graph: PR center → files → impacted areas
        ↓
AI risk assessment: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
        + deploy recommendation
        + "must verify" checklist
```

## AI Intelligence Features

### Code Provenance (`/provenance`)
Traces the full history of any public GitHub file. Fetches commit history → linked PRs → linked issues, generates per-node "why" summaries via Claude, then writes a holistic evolution narrative. Click a commit node to see the real diff. Toggle between force and timeline layouts.

→ Full guide: `aeon/CODE_PROVENANCE.md`

### Blast Radius (`/blast`)
Given any GitHub PR, classifies every changed file (Service / Test / Config / Pipeline / Infrastructure / Dependencies / Docs), infers which services are affected, and asks Claude for a risk level + deploy recommendation. Rendered as a radial graph with PR at center.

→ Full guide: `aeon/BLAST_RADIUS.md`

→ Best demo PR: `expressjs/express` #7233 (dependency upgrade touching 4 categories)

### Knowledge Graph (`/graph`)
Neo4j force-directed graph of all incident relationships — which error types recur, which pipelines share failures, which fixes resolved the same root cause across incidents.

---

## Memory Layer

**Two-stage retrieval** (`services/rerank.py`):
- Stage 1 — wide ChromaDB vector recall (top-10), the agent's own write-backs (`status=analyzed`) excluded so it never grounds on its own past output
- Stage 2 — weighted re-rank: `0.60·cosine + field agreement (error_type / pipeline / source / repo) + recency`; absent context reinforces the semantic signal. Emits human-readable `match_reasons` ("52% semantic", "same error_type") shown on the memory card

**GraphRAG expansion** (`services/graphrag.py`):
- Takes the vector matches as anchors and expands through Neo4j: error type → proven fixes (+ reuse counts) → sibling incidents on other pipelines
- That block is injected into the agent's system prompt, so the model reasons over graph relationships, not just the vector hits

**ChromaDB** — semantic vector store:
- Every incident stored with embeddings of description + logs + root cause
- Persists to `/data` (Chroma 1.x) so memory survives restarts; Code Provenance graphs cached for instant replay

**Neo4j** — relationship graph:
- Incident nodes: `Incident`, `Pipeline`, `ErrorType`, `Fix`; Provenance nodes: `ProvenanceNode` (File, Commit, PR, Issue, Developer)
- Connection **self-heals** the cold-start race (`_ensure_driver`, throttled reconnect) — no manual restart needed
- Visualized on the Knowledge Graph page

---

## LangGraph Agent

8 tools, streaming via `astream()`:

```python
tools = [
    search_chromadb_memory,   # semantic search over past incidents
    query_neo4j_graph,        # relationship traversal
    fetch_github_logs,        # GitHub Actions run logs
    fetch_jenkins_logs,       # Jenkins build console output
    create_github_issue,      # auto-create issues
    create_github_pr,         # suggest PRs (requires human approval)
    trigger_jenkins_build,    # trigger rebuilds
    trigger_n8n_workflow,     # fire n8n automations
]
```

Agent flow:
```
search_memory → call_claude → execute_tools (loop) → synthesize → memory_writer
```

`search_memory` also auto-fetches the failing Jenkins build log (for the job named in the query) to ground the first turn, then runs two-stage retrieval + GraphRAG. `call_claude` uses `llm.run_turn()` — **real tool-calling on either Azure OpenAI or Anthropic** (neutral Anthropic-shaped messages/tools are translated to OpenAI format for Azure). Every analysis is automatically written back to ChromaDB + Neo4j (`memory_writer_node`).

## Environment Variables

All in `aeon/backend/.env`:

```env
# --- LLM provider — set ONE (Azure wins if both present); mock works without any ---
# Azure OpenAI (AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT is the FULL chat-completions URL, incl. api-version)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<gateway>/deployments/gpt-5-mini/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-5-mini
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
# ...or Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# Optional: force a provider — azure | anthropic | mock (blank = auto-detect)
LLM_PROVIDER=

GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...             # Required for Code Provenance + Blast Radius at depth
GITHUB_ORG=                      # Your GitHub org (leave empty for personal repos)
JENKINS_URL=http://localhost:8080
JENKINS_USER=admin
JENKINS_TOKEN=admin
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=aeon_neo4j
CHROMA_HOST=localhost
CHROMA_PORT=8001
```

After editing `.env` (a recreate is required — `restart` does NOT re-read env_file):
```powershell
docker compose up -d backend
```
Adding Azure needs the `openai` package (already in `requirements.txt`) — rebuild if upgrading an old image: `docker compose build backend`.

## Key Design Decisions

- **`core/instances.py`** — shared singletons, no duplicate DB connections
- **Provider-agnostic LLM (`core/llm.py`)** — Azure OpenAI → Anthropic → mock, chosen at runtime; `run_turn()` gives the agent real tool-calling on both providers (Anthropic ⇄ OpenAI message/tool translation), `complete()` serves the single-shot surfaces
- **Two-stage retrieval + GraphRAG** — vector recall re-ranked by field agreement + recency, then expanded through the incident graph so the model reasons over relationships; the agent's own write-backs are excluded from grounding recall
- **SSE streaming everywhere** — AI Assistant, Code Provenance, and Blast Radius all stream progress to the browser via `text/event-stream`; the UI never blocks waiting for a response
- **`memory_writer_node`** — every incident analysis auto-stored, agent improves over time
- **Human-in-the-loop PRs** — issues auto-create, PRs require explicit approval
- **Resilient by design** — Neo4j self-heals the cold-start race (`_ensure_driver`); ChromaDB persists to `/data` so memory survives restarts; `reseed.ps1` restores demo memory after a `down -v`
- **`originalGraph` ref pattern** — ForceGraph2D mutates node objects in place; storing immutable server data separately prevents ghost traces when switching layouts
- **Mock fallback everywhere** — full demo works without any API tokens
- **Jenkins on port 8088** — remapped from 8080 to avoid WSL/Tomcat conflict
